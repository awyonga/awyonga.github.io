Hello, I am Amanda Awyong, a PhD Candidate in Accounting at Singapore Management University. I will be on the 2023-2024 academic job market and expect to graduate in May 2024. My research interest lies in the intersection of digital transformation and accounting. My work examines how firms are affected by, and react to, the advancement of digital technologies. In addition, I investigate how managers disclose information through social media platforms such as Twitter. More recently, I am interested in how Decentralized Finance (DeFi) platforms communicate blockchain information. My overall research strategy is to extract the richness of textual data by applying Natural Language Processing techniques to test traditional economic theories. 
<br><br>
I received my B.B.A (Accountancy) and B.A (Communications) from the National University of Singapore. Prior to my PhD studies, I had five years of working experience in corporate accounting and external audit. 
<br><br>
In my free time, I enjoy cycling and exploring the quieter parts of Singapore.
